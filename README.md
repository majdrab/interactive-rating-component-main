## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide)

### What I learned

I've used sass for the first time and it was great. I've also gone through the DOM events again, can't wait to get to know more of JS.

### Continued development

I definitely need to practice more, I'm still quite slow and have to google a lot. I'll try to do as many projects as my time allows.
